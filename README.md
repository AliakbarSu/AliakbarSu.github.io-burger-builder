# burger-builder

I built this project to practice making burgers for a restuarant I used to work at. To make a burger in the app you need to click 'new' then you can drag and drop the ingredients and serve the order to see the results (whether you made it correct or wrong) To access the app you can click on the live demo link or install it locally on your machine by cloning this repo.
